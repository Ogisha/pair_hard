Current game version: v.4beta

Basic Info
----------

"PAIR HARD or bust harder!" is an online logic game, coded completely using JavaScript.
It is developed using plain old (programming-framework-free) HTML/CSS/JS coding standards, with just a 
little bit of help from the always needed (and truly fantastic!) Handlebars.js, 
jQuery, Bootstrap and Underscore.js 


Game options
-----------

Player can choose between default options, ranging from 2x4 puzzles all the way to 4x18. But, There is 
an option of making your own custom table, as long as the basic logic rules are followed of course. 
General rules are the same for all the board sizes and types, though: pair up the hidden cards, and 
manage so in the shortest amount of time possible (watch for the timer!)
